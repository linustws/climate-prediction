    The Longest Text Ever!
    I am going to do it. I have made up my mind. These are the first few words of the new‚Ä¶ the best ‚Ä¶ the Longest Text
    In The Entire History Of The Known Universe! This Has To Have Over 35,000 words the beat the current world record
    set by that person who made that flaming chicken handbooky thingy. I might just be saying random things the whole
    time I type in this so you might get confused a lot. I just discovered something terrible. autocorrect is on!! no!!!
    this has to be crazy, so I will have to break all the English language rules and the basic knowledge of the average
    human being. I am not an average human being, however I am special. no no no, not THAT kind of special ;). Why do
    people send that wink face! it always gives me nightmares! it can make a completely normal sentence creepy. imagine
    you are going to a friend‚Äôs house, so you text this: [ see you soon üôÇ ] seems normal, right? But what is you add the
    word semi to that colon? (Is that right? or is it the other way around) what is you add a lorry to that briquettes?
    (Semi-truck to that coal-on) anyway, back to the point: [ see you soon üòâ ]THAT IS JUST SO CREEPY! is that really
    your friend, or is it a creepy stalker watching your every move? Or even worse, is it your friend who is a creepy
    stalker? maybe you thought it was your friend, but it was actually your fri end (let me explain: you are happily in
    McDonalds, getting fat while eating yummy food and some random dude walks up and blots out the sun (he looks like a
    regular here) you can‚Äôt see anything else than him, so you can‚Äôt try to avoid eye contact. he finishes eating his
    cheeseburger (more like horseburgher(I learned that word from the merchant of Venice(which is a good play(if you can
    understand it(I can cause I got a special book with all the words in readable English written on the side of the
    page(which is kinda funny because Shakespeare was supposed to be a good poet but no-one can understand him(and he‚Äôs
    racist in act 2 scene1 of the play too))))))) and sits down beside you , like you are old pals (you‚Äôve never met him
    before but he looks like he could be in some weird cult) he clears his throat and asks you a very personal question.
    ‚Äúcan i have some French fries?‚Äù (I don‚Äôt know why there called French fries when I‚Äôve never seen a French person eat
    fries! all they eat it is stuff like baguettes and cr√™pes and rats named ratty-two-ee which is a really fun game on
    the PlayStation 2) And you think ‚ÄúHahahahahhahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehheheheheh‚Ä¶..heeeheehe..hehe‚Ä¶ sigh. I
    remember that i was just about to eat one of my fries when I noticed something mushy and moist and [insert gross
    color like green or brown] on the end of one of my fries! now I can give it to this NERD!! ‚Äù (yes he is a nerd
    because all he does all day is watch the extended editions of the hobbit, lord of the rings and star wars and eat
    fat cakes (what the heck is a fat cake? I think it might be like a Twinkie or something)and twinkies(wow so is
    doesn‚Äôt really matter which is which because he eats both(i may have just done that so I didn‚Äôt have to Google what
    a fat cake is (right now I am typing on my iPhone 3gs anyway, which has a broken antenna so i can‚Äôt get internet
    anyway (it‚Äôs actually a really funny story that i‚Äôll tell you sometime)))and sit in his man cave with his friend
    named Joe (an ACTUAL friend, not a fri end)and all Joe does is watch sports like football with bob and all bob does
    is gamble ferociously (don‚Äôt ask(it means he buys all those bags of chips that say ‚Äúwin a free monkey or something
    if you find a banana in your bag*‚Äù(if there is a little star it means there is fine print so I always check the back
    of the package) *flips over the package* okay, it says: ‚Äúone of our workers accidentally threw a banana in the
    packing machine and we don‚Äôt want to get sued so we did this promotion thing‚Äù cool. Oh wow, this is salt and
    vinegar! my favourite! i hate cheese and onion.))and that‚Äôs pretty much his life, he lives in Jamaica with Naruto
    and his friends) so you give him that gross fri end he throws up all over you and me and the worker behind the
    counter who was still making an onion, and THAT is the story of the fri end, not a friend who somehow remembered
    your name and your phone number / email so he could text you saying he would come to your house soon. *finally takes
    a breath after typing a few hundred words about fri-ends* so what now? i know, i know, you think i ramble too much
    and use too many brackets (i don‚Äôt) but now i am going to talk about my amAZEing day. first i woke up, ate choco
    pops for breakfast even tho i always hate it when people say that cause i get jealous and super hungry. then i‚Ä¶ umm‚Ä¶
    yea! that was my day. you know that other person i mentioned before? that flaming chicken person? WELL. i will steal
    something from that person but do it better. i will‚Ä¶ drum roll please ‚Ä¶
    badabadabadabadabadabadabummmmmmmmmmmchshchshchshchshbadabadboumboumpoopoopichypichypichypowpow-crash! *a drum roll
    was just playing in the background* that drumroll was so long i forget what i was talking about. *scrolls up to see
    what he was writing about* oh yea! i will make my own FLAMING CHICKEN HANDBOOK! what things do i like? instead of
    flaming it could be rainbow, instead of chicken it could be fluffysheep and instead of handbook it could be handbook
    (not very creative, i know) but the total complete name is now to rainbow fluffysheep handbook! to make life easier
    for you guys, instead of taking random rules out of book willy nilly, i will take them out using my favourite
    numbers! so, section 5040 of the rainbow fluffysheep handbook states that the king of all oddly coloured farm
    animals (thats me!) is allowed to tell you any part out of this book randomly or if it is his one of his favorite
    numbers! 5040 is a great number because it is divisible by 60 integers which i don‚Äôt know. i‚Äôm tired. it is 10:41
    and i am getting sleepy‚Ä¶ hey hey hey! an intruder! remember that from pokepals rulers of time and darkness or
    something like that! with piplup and sunflora and chimchar! whaoh piplup is really hard to write on a tiny qwerty
    keyboard! try it! i realised that asdf is actually written in order on the qwerty keyboard! (just in case you didn‚Äôt
    know, asdf is an amazing short video clips cartoony thing on youtube i first learned bout on flipnote hatena, which
    is now shut down üò¶ ) what if one day they get rid of the qwerty keyboard completely! i will type it out for you just
    in case one day they get rid of it. qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm. there u go. Goodbye. I‚Äôm back! i decided that i
    should tell you about fonts. i always used the same font for my whole life, called arial. the reason is probably
    because it is on the top of the list in alphabetical order, and i was too lazy to scroll all the way down. only a
    few months ago did i finally decide to change my mind. i scrolled for what seemed to be an eternity, and i finally
    got to‚Ä¶ are you ready ‚Ä¶ arial black. yep, that was my big SCROLLING ADVENTURE! just yesterday, i was typing
    something on google docs and i found the new best font : roboto. its great! i could choose from FIVE different
    thicknesses. isn‚Äôt that amazing? right now we are driving behind a really slow ‚Äúfarm plastics collection‚Äù semi. i
    think i know someone obsessed with pokemon, but i can‚Äôt tell you who it is. he keeps making pokepals references and
    stuff. wow! you are a very loyal reader! if you have REALLY made it this far then you‚Ä¶ get a gold star on your
    loyalty chart! good job! this is looking to be the longest text ever, considering that this was all written in one
    day. i don‚Äôt understand sandwiches. if you were to eat bread, mayo and tomatoes separately it would be disgusting!
    you know all those fancy magazines/restaurants that always have really fancy food pictures with meat and brussels
    sprouts and all the old people say ‚Äúwow! that looks great!‚Äù and you think‚Äúit looks like the worst
    thing anyone could ever eat‚Äù and the you eat it and it tastes surprisingly‚Ä¶ WORSE than you imagined! gotta go‚Ä¶ im
    back! ive ive got stuff to say! your probably thinking‚Ä¶ HoW DoEs He HaVe So MuCh FrEe TiMe?!?! And the answer is‚Ä¶ i
    don‚Äôt. that‚Äôs right. this isn‚Äôt just some SIDE project. i‚Äôve gotta make time to do this if wanna get the world
    record. for all i know, the flaming chicken opponent who i will refer to from now on as sam (i don‚Äôt know why) is
    probably still adding to her posts. (i think i picked sam because it sounds like ham which is like cooked meat and
    so is flaming chicken, so you will remember that now ) i am officially going to make a quote from the rainbow
    fluffysheep handbook of knowledge and prestige (sounds catchy, huh?) . section 777 of the rainbow fluffysheep
    handbook STATES that the king of oddly colored farm animals (thats me!) is allowed to use whatever font he wants to.
    [now, i know what your thinking reader, that has nothing to do with anything. but it will come in handy someday
    (maybe)] sam makes me feels sick! im offended! (probably because i‚Äôm jealous of how much is written on that
    website(i dont even know how to make a website)) I‚ÄôVE JUST BEEN READING THIS AND I HAVE DISCOVERED A CONSPIRACY!
    THAT‚ÄôS RIGHT, I AM WORKING FOR DOCTOR SUESS! YES! i will prove it to you. i mentioned ham and sickness so green eggs
    and ham somehow! (why is he called doctor suess anyway? he‚Äôs not even a doctor *citation needed* and his books are
    kinda dumb! (funny considering i‚Äôm the one making that statement)) talking about eggs, aren‚Äôt eggs practically
    unborn chicken membrane? wouldn‚Äôt it be scary if you were casually eating your brembudder (riotous robots reference
    (wow! serious compilation of alliteration dedication!)) and drinking your tae wit‚Äô da guv‚Äôna (england doesn‚Äôt even
    have a govna! *citation needed*)(i‚Äôm not even racist i‚Äôm just quoting an accent of a race) and you go to crack an
    egg for your brekkie and BOOM! and unborn chicken embryo starts running towards you, picks up a knife and starts
    screaming ‚ÄúMAMA! MAMA!‚Äù you are so scared that you grab the nearest weaponry (a spoon) and poke the hideous beast.
    it is unaffected. luckily, the govener of Berwick-Upon-Tweed throws a sugar cube directly into the chicks mouth! as
    you know, sugar is EXTREMELY poisonous to chicken embryos *citation needed* (no more citations!) and you are saved!
    i‚Äôm sick and tired of citations! i will quote from the official rainbow fluffysheep handbook! section 12345679 (all
    the mathematicians are nodding their heads while the OCD people are twitching nervously in the corner) says that the
    king of oddly coloured farm animals does not have any obligation to write if a false piece of information needs a
    citation. great! now i feel like a free person! free i tell you, free! free from the prison cell i call the
    boundaries of untrue info. i think since im going to be the president of somewhere someday, i should have great
    speech here it goes: Hello great people of [name of place]! i am here to tell you; I am going to make [name of
    place] great again! i am going to lower taxes, but increase happiness! i am going to buy dog sweaters and bowls for
    people with dogs, and do some renovations on peoples tents! yes, this truly is a new era, the era of Epicness And
    Coolnehis tale lived on forever, being passed on generation to generation, living vividly in the hearts of the people.(that last bit sounded like the ending of an Asterix comic.)}
    i will now PROVE that all these things can happen. the first thing i said was that i will make America (i know, i
    know, i gave it away and told you the name) place grape again. (yes, that is what i said, bear with me here) i
    hereby DECLARE that every piece of American soil must be covered in vineyards. someone told me i should do that. i
    think i heard it through the grapevine (bad jokethat nobody understands) the next step is to lower taxes and raise
    happiness. to lower taxes i will get rid of all hospitals, and spend the taxes all on building fun playgrounds. this
    in turn, raises happiness (for the kids and for the non-injured if you know what i mean). finally, i will buy dog
    sweaters (on sale at your local liquidation world!) and dog bowls (just use little human bowls maybe?) and last but
    not least i will do renos on peoples tents (send chip and joanna from Fixer Upper to all the camping places). and,
    since all i said was (partial) truth, it will be a great era. anyway, gotttttttttttaaaaaaa ggggoooooo.
    bbbbbuuuuuuyyyy! im back. i just had thanksgiving while listening to christmas music and it was fun. we had bacon,
    ham and chicken but no turkey. its fall, but it‚Äôs ACTUALLY winter secretly. im watching a funny show. i‚Äôm back (even
    though i never said i was gone so you might be confused) hello loyal reader! if you have gotten this far without
    SKIMMING THROUGH then you are probably either lying, extremely bored (but not after reading this whole thing!) or
    VERY and i mean VERY dedicated. or all three. you know those homeless people that sit on the ground and ask for
    money? i think its all a conspiracy! after all, uow can they afford those dogs, sharpies, cardboard and enough
    english education to write ‚Äúneed help‚Äù? back in the roman times, only the richest, most important people could get
    things like that! you know the new fad, ‚Äòblack surfboards‚Äô? (neither did i until 15 seconds ago) someone related to
    me thinks they look really cool, i think they are neat but SOMEONE also related to me thinks they are bad because
    they would get warped. someWHERE ohohohohohohover the rainbowwwwww that reminds me, i was doing my normal thing,
    when BOOM! i started typing NONSENSE. so here it is, but be warned. its SCARILY NONSENSICAL. HeRe GoEs: The Epicness
    ‚Äì Hi how are you? Smells good ya! Think about that buddy (shower time) heheheheHAHAHA well thanks a lot so called
    buddy. Random things: joe be utterly hatin. Dat be da bomb ‚Äì Tink about tanking me. Interview: how does Joe like his
    pepperoni? ‚ÄúI be liken how I always eat it.‚Äù What first comes to Bobby‚Äôs mind when I say flabbergast? I don‚Äôt know,
    Flapper dress maybe that be it (20s style) hey dere ma-name JeFf‚Ä¶ Hell Ome Ine Ame Isej oe hey hey hey! an intruder!
    (DID U NEVER WATCH POK√âPALS?!?! im offended.) ANYHOO, the cattle hopped above the earth orbiting asteroid (a TWIST
    on an old tale) Are you OCD? Then don‚Äôt read anymore: :):):):):):):):):):);):):):):):) OR: 8)8)8)8)8)8)8)8)9)8)8)8)
